/**
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why should you learn about generics?
 *
 * 1. For intermediate developers, generics are where a lot of them get stuck.
 * 2. They are an important feature of all statically-typed language.
 * 3. Understanding them is key to leveling up yourself as a programmer.
 * 4. Once you understand generics in TypeScript, you will probably understand them in other languages.
 * 5. They are required to write effective programs in TypeScript.
 */

/**
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are generics?
 *
 * Emoji definition: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 *
 * Basic definition: "Placeholders" for types or "function arguments" for types.
 */

/**
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ My assumption about you:
 *
 * You've seen generics in programs before; however, you don't understand them well enough to use them,
 * but you've joined this session because you want to be able to use them!
 */

/**
 * 4Ô∏è‚É£ What are we doing to do right now?
 *
 * I'm going to build up the concept of generics with a few example and you are going
 * to ask questions or for additional examples on the fly so that we can build up
 * an intuition for generics.
 *
 * The examples aren't the best, but hopefully you can glean some value from them.
 *
 * We're (mostly) only going to be working with types today!
 */

/**
 * 5Ô∏è‚É£ What you can expect from me?
 *
 * After we're done here, you should feel free to DM me or setup a follow up session
 * so that I can help you become a better programmer.
 *
 * This is a very difficult subject, so I don't expect you to be a pro after we're done today.
 *
 * Again, the examples suck, so applying generics to something you're already working on
 * might help to reify the concept.
